# Political-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Forecasting
Analyzes political sentiment from Tamil tweets using Python. Tweets are scraped, translated, and processed using VADER and TextBlob for hybrid sentiment analysis. Optimized with preprocessing, multithreading, and caching to deliver accurate and efficient public opinion insights.

## Key Features 

### üìäHybrid Sentimental Analysis
Combines TextBlob (rule-based) and VADER (social-media-optimized) models for higher accuracy in classifying sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### üîçMulti-Party Comparison
Compare sentiment trends across multiple political parties simultaneously, with visualizations highlighting which party has the most favorable public perception.

### üìà Interactive Visualizations
Pie charts for sentiment distribution
Trend graphs showing sentiment over time
Comparative bar charts for side-by-side analysis

### üåêMultilingual Support 
Processes text in English, Tamil, and Thanglish (Tamil written in English script) by automatically detecting and translating non-English content.



### ‚ö°Real-Time Processing
Analyzes up to 5,000 tweets per party with a progress-tracking dashboard for large datasets.


## Installation & Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
